 * metamodel cache were done at the same time. Since we are using a independent thread schema
 * manager, it has no sense to do it in that way, but algorithms haven't been changed yet, so the
 * user thread transforms the data and then, if it detects a change on the metamodel, delegates on
 * the schema manager and it will execute the same code again (translating the data a second time)
 * and once the schema is changed, the user thread will transform the data again. Therefore, if
 * there a batch requires changes on the metamodel, it is translated three times!
